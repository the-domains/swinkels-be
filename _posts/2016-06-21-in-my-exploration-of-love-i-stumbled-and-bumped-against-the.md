In my exploration of LOVE, I stumbled and bumped against the word Hate, thank you for letting me share what I saw.

Some people will get trigger by the word Hate - as they are conditioned to label Hate as bad or have been hurt and now avoiding anything in this direction - and especially for them - let go and read on..

:-)

Love J

When people say they have a love/hate relationship with friends, fami

ly, colleagues or themselves! I wish they embrace this and acknowledge they are just beautiful human beings like everyone else:-)

Hate is the extreme energy of separation, ultimately killing life

Love is the extreme energy of being one, ultimately giving life

Hate is the extreme of male energy that is used for survival of the individual

Love is the extreme of female energy that is used for uniting, becoming one

(every man and woman has male and female energy.!)

Hate is seen as bad in our society and we are conditioned to suppress this kind of energy as it is or can be destructive and yet we see it in adults, relationships, broken friendships, animals and even children can say it to their parents or friends when they are not allowing them to do or have what they want.

Love is seen as good in our society and we are conditioned to show this kind of energy although often used for -getting what we want-

Hate is an - energy direction - starting with: withholding -\> not giving -\> judging -\> unconsciously taking -\> being right -\> arguing -\> naming -\> accusing -\> (un)consciously hurting (mental physical) -\> hating -\> and sometimes even leading to killing

Love is an -energy direction - starting with: not withholding -\> being there -\> connecting -\> listening -\> giving -\> acknowledging -\> holding -\> caring -\> nurturing -\> giving birth to new creations or new life

Ego uses Hate to protect itself

Ego uses Love to take (ai...:( difficult one to acknowledge)

Consciousness doesn't have any labels saying love nor hate, it just is:-) (Love on a different level:-)

When â€žBeing" comes into our duality life as experience, in order to have Love there also need to be the opposite: Hate.

It's not to suppress this energy direction or act as if we wouldn't have it - it will cost lots of energy to suppress and probably will show up in your internal world (f.e. self-hate) or external world.

It's to acknowledge that both energies are part of our life experiences and YOU are the one choosing which energie you put into what constructive purpose.

Free yourself from suppressing hate energy - Love your hate energy

:-)

and your -hate energy- will let itself be used for YOU and not against YOU or US (as YOU are ME and US:-)
